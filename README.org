#+TITLE: The Carth programming language

Rewrite of [[https://github.com/bryal/kvasir][kvasir]] in Haskell.

Purely functional programming with lisp-syntax. Less infix, more parens!

** Features

- Scheme-inspired syntax and feel
- Static, Hindley-Milner typechecking Ã  la ML
- Currying
- Compiled with LLVM-based backend

** TODO Examples

** Roadmap

This is a high-level overview of what is planned for the language, and
some of the points are just tentative. See [[./TODO.org][TODO.org]] for more extensive
list of planned features and more detailed descriptions.

- Algebraic datatypes
- Typeclasses
- Higher kinded types
- Effect system
- Linear types

** Building
   This project is written in [[https://haskell.org][Haskell]] and uses the [[https://www.haskellstack.org/][Stack]] build
   system. The external dependencies required are [[https://llvm.org/][LLVM]] version 8. To
   build the project, simply run ~stack build~. To install (copy the
   binary), run ~stack install~.

** Running
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
# General help
carth help
carth -h
carth --help

# Help for a specific subcommand
carth help interpret
carth help c

# Interpret a file
carth i examples/test.carth

# Compile and run a program with default output filename
carth c examples/test.carth
./out

# Compile a program with a specific output filename
carth c -o examples/test.bin examples/test.carth
./examples/test.bin
   #+END_EXAMPLE
