#+TITLE: The Carth programming language
#+INCLUDE: "./page.org"

Rewrite of [[https://github.com/bryal/kvasir][kvasir]] in Haskell.

Purely functional programming with lisp-syntax. Less infix, more parens!

** Features
   - Scheme-inspired syntax and feel
   - Static, Hindley-Milner typechecking Ã  la ML
   - Currying
   - Compiled with LLVM-based backend
   - [[file:REFERENCE.org::#Literate-Carth][Native support for literate programming in Org-mode]]

** Examples
   Not much is working yet, but here's an example of something simple
   that compiles and runs today. Note that impure functions like
   ~printInt~ only temporarily exist for development purposes.

   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
   (define (main _)
     (seq (printInt (id 1337))
          (seq (printInt 42)
               (printInt 69))))
   (define (id x) x)
   (define (seq _ b) b)
   #+END_SRC

** Roadmap

   This is a high-level overview of what is planned for the language, and
   some of the points are just tentative. See [[./TODO.org][TODO.org]] for more extensive
   list of planned features and more detailed descriptions.

   - Algebraic datatypes
   - Typeclasses
   - Higher kinded types
   - Effect system
   - Linear types

** Building
   This project is written in [[https://haskell.org][Haskell]] and uses the [[https://www.haskellstack.org/][Stack]] build
   system. The external dependencies required are [[https://llvm.org/][LLVM]] version 8. To
   build the project, simply run ~stack build~. To install (copy the
   binary), run ~stack install~.

** Running
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
   # General help
   carth help
   carth -h
   carth --help

   # Help for a specific subcommand
   carth help interpret
   carth help c

   # Interpret a file
   carth i examples/test.carth

   # Compile and run a program with default output filename
   carth c examples/test.carth
   ./out

   # Compile a program with a specific output filename
   carth c -o examples/test.bin examples/test.carth
   ./examples/test.bin
   #+END_EXAMPLE
