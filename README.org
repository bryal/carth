#+TITLE: The Carth programming language

Purely functional programming with lisp-syntax. Less infix, more parens!

Visit [[https://carth.jo.zone/][https://carth.jo.zone/]] for an overview of the language and more info.

* /WORK IN PROGRESS/
  Just as a little disclaimer: this project is in the very early
  stages of development, so there are no guarantees of stability etc.

* Features
  - Scheme-inspired syntax and feel
  - Static, Hindley-Milner typechecking Ã  la ML
  - Currying
  - Closures
  - Algebraic datatypes
  - LLVM-based backend

* Roadmap
  This is a high-level overview of what is planned for the language, and
  some of the points are just tentative. See [[./TODO.org][TODO.org]] for more extensive
  list of planned features and more detailed descriptions.

  - Typeclasses
  - Higher kinded types
  - Effect system
  - Linear types

* Building
  The compiler is writtern in [[https://haskell.org][Haskell]] and uses the [[https://www.haskellstack.org/][Stack]] build system,
  while the core-library is written in [[https://rust-lang.org][Rust]]. The external dependencies
  required are [[https://llvm.org/][LLVM]] version 9.

  To build the project and install the ~carth~ binary, the core
  library, and the standard library, simply run ~make install~, which
  defaults to installing everything in ~~/.carth/~.

* Running
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
  # General help
  carth help
  carth -h
  carth --help

  # Help for a specific subcommand
  carth help c

  # Compile and run a program with default output filename
  carth c examples/fizzbuzz.carth
  ./out

  # Compile a program with a specific output filename
  carth c -o examples/fizzbuzz examples/fizzbuzz.carth
  ./examples/fizzbuzz
  #+END_EXAMPLE
