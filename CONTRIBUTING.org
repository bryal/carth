* Versioning and basic git workflow

  The ~master~ branch should always build, and development should
  happen on the ~dev~ branch.

  During development, the version (in package.yaml etc) should be the
  version being developed, with an implicit -alpha. When a release is
  ready, tag the last commit with the current version, and merge to
  master. The immediately following commit should bump the minor
  version by one in package.yaml and create a new, empty entry for the
  version we're beginning work on in the changelog. The version is not
  bumped in master, as we want to leave room for patch versions.

  The entry of the currently developed version in the changelog should
  be continously populated as features are added and everything is
  fresh in memory.

  If a bug is fixed, apply that particular commit to master as well
  (cherry-pick?). On master, also add a commit that bumps the patch
  version and adds a tag for the patch release.
