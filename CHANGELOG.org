* 0.0.2 <2019-10-30>
  Trying out releases -- this is the first one, more or
  less. Everything has been in such heavy development until now (and
  still is really, but it has calmed down slightly), so this feels
  like the first appropriate moment to make a release.

  Nothing is ready to use yet, of course, but many of the core
  components are here. We have parsing with megaparsec, Hindley-Milner
  typechecking, algebraic datatype definitions and pattern matching
  with exhaustiveness and redundancy checking, closures,
  interpretation, and LLVM code generation.

  Next up is modules, typeclasses, etc etc.
