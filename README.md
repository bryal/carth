The Carth programming language
==============================

*Purely functional programming with lisp-syntax. Less infix, more parens!*

Visit <https://carth.pink/> for an overview of
the language and more info.

WORK IN PROGRESS
------------------

Just as a little disclaimer: this project is still in alpha
development, so there are no guarantees of stability etc.

Features
--------

- Scheme-inspired syntax and feel
- Static, Hindley-Milner typechecking Ã  la ML
- Currying
- Closures
- Algebraic datatypes
- LLVM backend

Roadmap
-------

This is a high-level overview of what is planned for the language, and
some of the points are just tentative. See [TODO.org](./TODO.org) for
more extensive list of planned features and more detailed descriptions.

- Typeclasses
- Type families
- Higher kinded types
- Effect system
- Linear types

Building Carth
--------------

The compiler is written in [Haskell](https://haskell.org) and uses the
[Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/) build system, while the
core-library is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). The external
dependencies required are [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) version 9.

To build the project and install the `carth` binary, the core library,
and the standard library, simply run `make install`, which defaults to
installing the binary in `~/.local/bin`, the core library in
`~/.local/lib`, and the modules of the Carth standard library in
`~/.carth/mod`.

Building with Carth
-------------------

At compiler runtime, the dependencies are `libsigsegv`, `libdl`,
`libpthread`, `libm`, and `libgc`, which are linked into the executables
produced by Carth.

Carth must further be able to find the core library and standard library
modules, so you must have added the directory of the installed core
library (default `~/.local/lib`) to your `LIBRARY_PATH` environment
variable, the directory of the installed standard library (default
`~/.carth/mod`) to your `CARTH_MODULE_PATH` environment variable.

Running
-------

```bash
# General help
carth help
carth -h
carth --help

# Help for a specific subcommand
carth help c

# Compile and run a program with default output filename
carth c examples/fizzbuzz.carth
./out

# Run with the JIT compiler
carth run examples/fizzbuzz.carth

# Compile a program with a specific output filename
carth c -o examples/fizzbuzz examples/fizzbuzz.carth
./examples/fizzbuzz
```

License
-------

Carth is released under the AGPL license, version 3 or later. See
[LICENSE](./LICENSE).

Note that by default, all programs written in Carth will have to be
distributed under the AGPLv3 license as well, as not just the compiler
itself, but also the standard library you include and the core library
you link with are AGPLv3 licensed. Technically you could write your own
standard library and core library with some non-copyleft license to
avoid this, but I hope you won't! ;)
