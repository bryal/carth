;; Test case for bug fixed in 44eff82c6474
;;
;; This test case is a bit artificial and could possibly me a little simpler and cleaner,
;; but this is good enough.
;;
;; Change the Int8 in the Either to Int, and it starts working (pre-fix).
;;
;; The issue was that (Either (Fun Unit Unit)) ended up being represented by the Right
;; variant, which in the pre-fix LLVM representation resulted in implicit padding of 7
;; bytes between the Int8 and the following (Cons Int Unit). When (<o id id) was passed to
;; foo in either/map-left, LLVM for some reason decided that the 7 bytes of padding could
;; be zeroed, since it didn't think we could use them anyways. Maybe it passed the Int8 in
;; a separate register, with the higher bytes zeroed or something. Anyways, this resulted
;; in the captures pointer of the Fun in the Either having all but its least significant
;; byte zeroed, et voila, segfault!
